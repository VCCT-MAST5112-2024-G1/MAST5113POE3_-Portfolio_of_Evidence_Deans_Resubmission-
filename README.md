The background information
I was tasked to create an app for a chef named Christoffel chef. He needed an app that will serve
as a menu option for his customers. Whatever the chef prepared he can upload those new dishes on the
" add dish page ", and they can click " add new dish " button those dishes will be added to the homepage
for user to see what the dish is, the description and the prices for those meals. There will be three
types of dishes " meals ", "desserts" and "starters". These dishes are the main meal types
for the customer and if the chef decides the remove a certain meal they can on the filter 
page and those changes will be present on the homepage.
